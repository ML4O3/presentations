# TOAR-II ML4O3 review paper

After discussion amongst the committee, we propose a review and a forward look covering the recent literature in the use of ML, AI and other data-driven methods in tropospheric ozone research.

Draft sections:

- Describe /assess / benchmark existing methods for ozone forecasting.  Assess the ability of such observation-driven models for infilling/forecasting of criteria pollutants.  Scales: prediction of ozone on timescale of hours, spatial scale of few kms
- Use of ML and AI techniques in CTM/CCM/ESMs.  Chemical solvers, replacement for model components, parameterisations, projections of future ozone levels, 
- Preparation Earth Observation / reanalysis / data fusion ozone products, successes, challenges, applications.
- Bias correction, sub-grid scale processes, future ozone projections
- Impacts - health e.g. Ziegler - how to connect ML to other models, e.g. epidemiology, vegetation?

# Planned activities 2024 (and beyond?)

- Seminars/meetings - ML4O3 could be a nice platform for community building. 
- Hosting scoping meetings in support of TOAR-II activities to assess the capacity of the community for 
    - an infilling/interpolation best practice working group to add value to observational datasets, e.g. TOAR OPT, TOAR-Oceans.
    - assessment of TOAR-II database / classification of site characteristics, developing best practice for CCM/CTM evaluation using TOAR products
